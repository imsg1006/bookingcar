## Overview


This project is a cab booking dashboard web app that allows users to view and manage vehicle bookings efficiently. It features a sidebar navigation, booking details view, date range filters, and real-time stats like total, upcoming, and cancelled bookings. The interface is styled with a bold black and yellow theme for a modern, striking look. Built with Next JS and TailwindCSS, it ensures a responsive, smooth experience ideal for both customers and admins managing transportation services.

## Development Approach

I adhered to industry-standard design principles by prioritizing reusable components and employing tailwind CSS. Embracing the DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) principle, I minimized code duplication and enhanced maintainability. This approach ensures consistent design across the project while optimizing development efficiency and scalability.
